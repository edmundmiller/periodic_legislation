"MT","Bill HB498: ""Establish a Menstrual Equity Act"" aims to create legislation focused on menstrual equity. The bill's description is brief and doesn't provide specific details about its contents or proposed changes.","Based on the limited information provided, it's challenging to determine the state's overall support for menstrual care accessibility. There is only one bill mentioned, which suggests some interest in addressing menstrual equity. However, without more details about the bill's contents, proposed changes, or current status, it's impossible to gauge the level of support or the specific measures being considered. The state appears to be taking initial steps towards addressing menstrual care accessibility, but more information would be needed to make a definitive assessment.","Yo, check it out! 👀 This state's tryna get on the period positivity train with their Menstrual Equity Act. Ngl, they're being pretty sus with the deets, but at least they're not ghosting the issue completely. 🤷‍♀️ It's like they're dipping their toes in the menstrual pool, but we need more tea to spill before we can say if they're really about that life. Maybe they're just shy about talking periods? 😅 Either way, it's a start, but let's hope they come through with some real talk soon. Period. 💯"
"SD","Bill HB1159 aims to exempt feminine hygiene products from the state sales tax. The bill's main purpose is to reduce the financial burden on individuals who menstruate by making these essential products more affordable.","Based on the limited information provided, it appears that this state is taking steps towards supporting menstrual care accessibility. The proposal to exempt feminine hygiene products from sales tax demonstrates an awareness of the financial burden these products can pose. However, with only one bill mentioned, it's difficult to determine the overall level of support for menstrual care accessibility in the state. The current status of the bill (whether it has passed, is pending, or has failed) is not provided, which makes it challenging to assess the effectiveness of this legislative effort.","Yo, listen up! 👋 This state's tryna be lowkey cool with the period care sitch, ngl. They're like, ""Let's yeet that sales tax off tampons and pads!"" 🩸💸

Fr tho, it's a start, but they ain't exactly going ham on the whole menstrual equity thing yet. One bill? That's cute, I guess. 🙄 But hey, at least they're not ghosting the issue completely.

If this bill passes, it'll be a small W for everyone who's out here bleeding every month. But let's be real, we need more than just a lil tax break to make periods less of a pain (literally and figuratively). 😩

So, to sum it up: This state's giving us some ""we see you"" vibes, but they're not exactly period care champions... yet. Maybe they just need a good TikTok trend to get them fully on board? #PeriodPower anyone? 💁‍♀️🔴"
"WY","Bill SF0086 and Bill SF0027 are both titled ""Essential health product dignity act"" and have identical descriptions. These bills aim to establish a tax exemption for feminine hygiene products and diapers in relation to sales and use taxes. The main purpose is to make these essential health products more affordable by removing tax burdens. The bills don't specify target locations but focus on the products themselves.","The state appears to be somewhat supportive of menstrual care accessibility. There are two identical bills proposed, which suggests a strong interest in passing this legislation. The bills focus on making feminine hygiene products more affordable by exempting them from sales and use taxes. This approach addresses the financial barrier to accessing menstrual care products.

However, the limited scope of the bills (only addressing tax exemption) and the lack of information about their current status make it difficult to determine the full extent of the state's support. The repetition of the same bill might indicate either a renewed effort to pass the legislation or a clerical error in the system.

Overall, the state seems to be taking steps towards improving menstrual care accessibility, but more comprehensive legislation or information about the implementation of these bills would be needed to classify the state as strongly supportive.","Yo, period pals! 🩸 Let's spill the tea on this state's period care game, fr fr.

So, we've got these twin bills tryna make periods less of a pain in the wallet. They're all about axing taxes on period products and diapers. Ngl, it's giving ""basic human dignity"" vibes, and we're here for it! 👏

But here's the tea: it's giving bare minimum energy. Like, cool, you want to make tampons cheaper, but what about free products in schools? Or homeless shelters? C'mon, bestie, we can do better!

Still, it's a start, I guess? 🤷‍♀️ At least they're not totally ghosting the issue. But tbh, we need more deets on whether these bills are actually gonna become a thing or if they're just gonna sit there collecting dust like my old geometry textbook.

So, final verdict? This state's period care game is like a 6/10. It's not on fleek, but it's not a total flop either. Let's hope they level up soon and start serving some real period equality realness! 💅"
"ND","Bill SB2254 aims to create a sales and use tax exemption for tampons and sanitary napkins in North Dakota. It proposes adding a new subsection to the existing tax code to implement this exemption.

Bill HB1282 also focuses on creating a sales and use tax exemption, but for a broader category of ""feminine hygiene products"" in North Dakota. This bill seeks to amend an existing subsection of the tax code to include these products in the list of tax-exempt items.

Both bills aim to provide an effective date for the proposed changes.","North Dakota appears to be taking steps towards supporting menstrual care accessibility. The state has proposed two bills that focus on making period products more affordable by exempting them from sales and use taxes. This approach can help reduce the financial burden of purchasing essential menstrual hygiene items.

The bills target different product categories, with SB2254 specifically mentioning tampons and sanitary napkins, while HB1282 uses the broader term ""feminine hygiene products."" This suggests a comprehensive approach to addressing the issue.

While these bills demonstrate a positive intent, it's important to note that they are still in the proposal stage. The overall legislative support seems to be moving in a supportive direction, but the final outcome will depend on whether these bills pass and are implemented.","Yo, listen up! 👋 North Dakota's out here tryna be period-positive, and ngl, it's kinda lit! 🔥

They're all like, ""Let's yeet those taxes on period products!"" Two bills are in the mix, and they're both giving major ""we got you"" vibes for anyone who menstruates. One's all about tampons and pads, while the other's keeping it real with all feminine hygiene products. Talk about options! 👏

Fr though, if these bills pass, it could be a game-changer for wallet-friendly period care. North Dakota's lowkey saying, ""Periods are expensive enough, let's not make 'em worse with taxes."" And I'm here for it! 💯

So, are they period heroes yet? Not quite, but they're def on their way. Keep an eye out, 'cause if these bills become law, it'll be time to celebrate! Maybe we'll even see a TikTok dance about tax-free tampons? 💃🕺 #PeriodPower #TaxFreeTampons"
"ID","Bill S1330: Aims to update archaic language in existing laws, removing redundant and obsolete terms. Not directly related to period care.

Bill H0313: Proposes to add a requirement for the provision of feminine hygiene products in schools. This bill is directly related to menstrual care accessibility.","Based on the provided information, the state's legislative support for menstrual care accessibility appears to be limited but emerging.

The other two bills (S1330 and S1273) are not related to menstrual care accessibility.

The presence of Bill H0313 suggests that there is some recognition of the need for improved access to menstrual care products in educational settings. However, the lack of additional bills or broader initiatives indicates that the state's support for menstrual care accessibility is still in its early stages and not yet comprehensive.

Without information on the current status of Bill H0313 (whether it has passed, is pending, or has failed), it's difficult to determine the full extent of the state's commitment to this issue. Overall, the state appears to be taking initial steps towards supporting menstrual care accessibility, but there is room for more comprehensive legislation and support.","Yo, listen up! 👋 We're about to spill the tea on this state's period game, and ngl, it's kinda meh. 😕

So, we've got three bills in the mix, but only one is actually about the crimson wave. 🌊 Bill H0313 is like, ""Hey schools, time to stock up on those period products!"" Which is lowkey a vibe, fr. 👏

But here's the tea: the other two bills are just chilling, doing their own thing. They're not even in the period chat. 🤷‍♂️

So, are we impressed? Eh, not really. It's giving ""bare minimum"" energy. 😬 Like, good start, but we need more! Where's the period party at? 🎉 We're talking free tampons in every bathroom, people!

TL;DR: This state is trying, but it's not exactly setting the period world on fire. 🔥 Let's hope they step up their game and make periods less of a hassle for everyone. Period. 💅"

Fr though, it's giving very much ""we don't see you"" vibes when it comes to making period products more accessible. No bills, no plans, nada. It's like they're living in 1922 instead of 2022, smh.
