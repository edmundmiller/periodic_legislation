MT,"","","Alright, fam, let's dive into this period care tea from Montana! 🏔️🩸

So, we've got this bill called HB498 that's trying to establish a ""Menstrual Equity Act."" Sounds pretty lit, right? 🔥 This bad boy was introduced in the 2023 Regular Session, and it's still making its way through the legislative process. It's like, not quite there yet, but it's on a journey, you know?

The bill's all about that menstrual equity life, which is basically saying ""Hey, let's make sure everyone who needs period products can actually get them!"" It's giving major inclusivity vibes, and we're here for it! 👏

Now, here's the tea on where it's at:
- Introduced on February 12, 2023 (that's when it started its glow-up)
- It's chillin' in the House right now, waiting for its moment to shine
- No committee has claimed it yet, so it's like waiting to be picked for the team in gym class

But here's the real talk: Montana's not exactly leading the pack when it comes to period care accessibility. This bill is like that one friend who's trying to get the group chat hyped for a night out – it's got the right idea, but we're not sure if everyone's gonna show up, you feel me?

Overall, Montana's giving us ""we're trying"" energy when it comes to menstrual care. It's like they've heard about the period poverty problem and they're like ""Oh snap, we should probably do something about that."" But they're not quite at the ""OMG, free tampons for everyone!"" level yet.

So, to sum it up in true Zoomer style:
Montana's period care game: 🤔
Potential for glow-up: 💯
Current vibe: ""We're working on it, bestie!""

Keep your eyes on this one, folks! It might just be the start of Montana's period care revolution. Stay tuned and stay flowy! ✌️🌊"
